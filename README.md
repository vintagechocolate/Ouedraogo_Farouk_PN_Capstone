This is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) stack. The application allows users to perform CRUD operations on a MongoDB database through a RESTful API built with Express and Node.js. The front-end is built with React, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the application.

Features

    User Authentication: Users can register and log in to the application using a secure authentication system.
    Data Management: Authenticated users can create, read, update, and delete data entries stored in the MongoDB database.
    Data Visualization: The application provides a clean and intuitive user interface for displaying and interacting with the data.
    Search and Filtering: Users can search and filter the data based on various criteria, making it easier to find specific entries.


Technologies Used

    MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing and retrieving application data.
    Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, used for building the RESTful API.
    React.js: A JavaScript library for building the user interface components and managing the application state.
    Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side code.
    JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Used for user authentication and authorization.
    React Router: Used for client-side routing and rendering different views based on the URL.
    Axios: Used for making HTTP requests to the RESTful API from the React front-end.
